I think that one of the "words of the year" for me for 2026 is _generosity_. I would like to be more generous with _me_, my personality, and with wisdom. Even the [The Way of The Bodhisattva](https://www.lotsawahouse.org/indian-masters/shantideva/bodhicharyavatara-3) calls for generosity with wisdom. There's a translation of the text from our local [Zen Buddhist Temple](https://www.zenbuddhisttemple.org/chicago) (Sunim lineage) that I like, but I can't find it anywhere.

I've refrained from generosity in some ways because I've thought that sharing wisdom would be taken poorly, or for fear of judgment. I've also refrained from being generous with _who I am_ because, well, I just haven't had the confidence to do so. I feel like that's changing for me this year, which I'm really happy about!

So, in the spirit of generosity, I'd like to speak plainly about something which I doubt many of you reading this will find novel in any way. In the off-chance that you do find it novel, well, maybe that made this post worth it. I suppose even writing here made that post worth it, since this will be my first _post_ here.

Anyway, I was talking to my wife, who asked one of her co-workers whether or not he believes in salvation through faith or through good works. He answered that he believes in salvation through surrender to god.

I said that this is indeed true, [before one becomes united with god](https://www.sofiatopia.org/equiaeon/7ways.htm). After this, which happens in one's lifetime, one realizes that everyone is a part of God. That everyone is a god, though some aren't aware of it, and many work to actively undermine God. That we are all connected, and that there are real consequences to not making the most of this lifetime.

That being that when you die, it's possible that you'll be reincarnated into worse conditions, because the world continues to become worse and not better. There is both a very selfish reason to complete good works, beyond the moral imperative of realization that _our "souls" are not at all different_.

I hope you are having a lovely day, and happy new year.
